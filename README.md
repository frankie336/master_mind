# master_mind: Service-Based Reusable Architecture for Neural Network Training

Welcome to `master_mind`â€”a robust framework designed for the efficient training of neural networks. Our solution is tailored to meet the demands of both rapid prototyping and large-scale production, enabling seamless neural network training with an emphasis on modularity and scalability.

## Features

- **Modularity**: Our design allows you to easily interchange components as needed, ensuring your architecture remains adaptable and up-to-date.
- **Service Orientation**: We prioritize maintainability and clarity through a clear separation of concerns within our service-oriented structure.
- **Framework Agnostic**: `master_mind` supports various neural network frameworks, offering you the freedom to choose the best tool for the job.
- **Scalability**: Catering to datasets and models of any size, from the smallest to the most complex, our system scales with your needs.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Iterative experiment results are automatically saved and organized in a model registrar document, ensuring that you can track and measure progress over time.
- **Graphical Insights**: Accurately visualize your model's performance with automatically saved accuracy graphs, allowing for intuitive analysis and reporting.
- **Google Colab Integration**: Enjoy the seamless integration with Google Colab, automatically leveraging its powerful CUDA-enabled GPU environment for accelerated training.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Prepare your environment with the following:

- Python 3.8+
- Pip package manager
- Your chosen neural network frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)

### Installation

Clone the repository and prepare your virtual environment:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/frankie336/master_mind.git
cd master_mind
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Unix or MacOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


Google Colab Setup:

```shell
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


Google Colab Setup:

1. Mount your Google Drive to access your notebooks and data:

```shell
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')


2. Clone your repository into your drive for persistent storage:

```shell
%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/YourProjectFolder
!git clone https://github.com/your-repo/master_mind.git


3. Navigate to your project directory and start training::

```shell
%cd master_mind
# Run your training script here
